/**
 * Force-refresh a mother's record on demand.
 *
 * WhatsApp call permission is the one field on this record that changes
 * WITHOUT anyone in the portal doing anything: she taps Allow (or Decline) in
 * WhatsApp and Meta posts a webhook to the backend. The browser has no way to
 * learn that, and a temporary grant can also lapse on its own while the page
 * sits open.
 *
 * We deliberately do NOT poll for it — a background interval per open mother
 * record is real, permanent DB load for an event that happens a handful of
 * times a day. Instead the refresh is event-driven: the clinician gets a fresh
 * read at the moment they are about to act on it (opening the Call-now menu),
 * on top of React Query's existing refetch-on-window-focus. Cost is one
 * request per actual look, and nothing at all in the background.
 *
 * `invalidateQueries` rather than `refetch`: it bypasses the 30s global
 * `staleTime` (App.tsx) — which exists to suppress redundant fetches, and is
 * exactly the wrong behaviour when the clinician has explicitly asked to see
 * current state — and it refreshes every mounted consumer of the key, so the
 * mother record and the call-detail footer cannot disagree.
